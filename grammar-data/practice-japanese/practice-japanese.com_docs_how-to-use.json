You might discover nuances you missed.\n\nQ: Should I memorize everything? A: No. Focus on understanding patterns. Memory comes through use.\n\nQ: Do I need a textbook too? A: This guide IS comprehensive, but textbooks provide structure and exercises. Use both.\n\nQ: What if I don't understand something? A: Normal! Mark it, continue forward, return later. Context from later topics often clarifies earlier confusion."

When you understand the logic, everything clicks.\n\nConsistency > Intensity\n\nStudy 30 minutes daily beats 3 hours weekly. Your brain needs daily exposure to build neural pathways.\n\nProduction > Recognition\n\nDon't just read. Write sentences. Speak aloud. Use the grammar. Active production cements understanding.\n\nPatience > Perfection\n\nYou'll make mistakes. That's learning. Native speakers understand imperfect Japanese. Focus on communication, refine accuracy over time."
